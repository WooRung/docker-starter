# Docker Starter pacakge

There are too many configurations on docker and each product(program), even though the core was few.
So, I just create this repo to start fast by doing config only core env

# How to use

Just configuration with .env and volume and run below  
`docker run -v <volumes:volume> --env-file .env <images>`  
or  
`docker compose up`
